# Welcome to Project CS

!!! Info "Note"
    Site Under construction

Project CS is an experimental website for Msc CS students of UCD. 
Students can write notes for lecture and maintain them. The main aim 
is to spread knowledge of CS with everyone and to maintain an archive. 
Personal interpretations of topics are encouraged rather than a blatant 
copy of presentations. 
The Website is still in its pre-alpha build. And may change considerably 
based on requirements and inputs. The website will be hosted both as a github page 
and if possible a standalone page. Github page will ensure that other authors 
can quickly deploy the articles and get reflected online instantly and everyone 
gets to keep source code of website.
I've decided to make the Site using `Mkdocs` so that everyone can concentrate on 
writting and not on technical aspects of it.

## How to use the site
